# Product details

If the user selects a product the product detail view is opened on the right side. The detail view has variable contents depending on the selected product.

## Editing a product

By pressing the edit button the application changes to edit mode and the user can change some settings of the selected product. If the user presses `Cancel` all changes are discarded. `Save` saves all changes to the server.

## Revisions

The user can create revision to each product. To do so the user clicks on the ´New Revision´ button and changes in the dialog the revision number and enters an optional comment. If the user wants to see an older revision he can open the revision dialog by pressing the `Revisions` button.
