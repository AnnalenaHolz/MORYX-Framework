# Overview

In the article [Resource type tree](xref:ResourceTypeTree) are different branches of the resource type tree described. Those branches are types derived from either Resource or PublicResource. Each of those branches contains a certain type of resources that share common traits or represent similar objects. The `AL` deﬁnes some resource types that create branches of resources and applications from different domains can deﬁne additional branches for resources from their respective business ﬁelds. The control system for example deﬁnes the abstract resource type cell as a branch in the type tree.
