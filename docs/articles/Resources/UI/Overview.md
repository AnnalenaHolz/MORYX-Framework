# Resources

By default the resource management comes with a graphical UI shown in image below that is already part of the current version and was only adapted to the new server side architecture. The UI accesses the resource graph over a web-service hosted by the default implementation of IRootResource. The UI visualizes a resource tree on the left and a details view on the right. The web-service as well as the UI is optional and can easily be removed or replaced by applications.
